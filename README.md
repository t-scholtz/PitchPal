# PitchPal

An Arduino based project aimed at creating a reliable and user-friendly pitch/tuning tool.

## Project Overview
Musicians of all levels, from beginners to pros, desire pitch perfection, but traditional tuning methods are often inaccurate and time-consuming. In response, we're developing a user-friendly device that provides real-time pitch feedback, allowing users to select their desired pitch. This innovation enhances musical precision and empowers musicians, offering a valuable tool for the entire musical community.

## Project Contents
This project directory consists of two main folders:
** src **
This directory contains two sub directories, main and test. Main contains all of the code for this project, and test contains a series of tests, each designed to test a specific part of the project
** examples **
This directory contains several code exeherts and examples from external sources, along with some notes of where the code was obtained, and how it is used.


## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the Pitch Tuner Arduino Project:

1. **Download Relavant Libaries:**
   - WString
   - arduinoFFT
   - LiquidCrystal_I2C
   - Wire

2. **Hardware Setup**
   - Ensure that all components are connected, and that there are no loose wires
   - Plug Arduino into a power source
   
3. **Complie and upload**
   - Compile code using an Arduino compbatible comipler
   - Upload code to device


## Useage
After successfully setting up the project, you should be greeted with a short start up animation.
From here the user should be able to just follow on screen prompts in order to use the device.
