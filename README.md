# PitchPal

An Arduino based project aimed at creating a reliable and user-friendly pitch/tuning tool.

## Project Overview
Musicians of all levels, from beginners to pros, desire pitch perfection, but traditional tuning methods are often inaccurate and time-consuming. In response, we're developing a user-friendly device that provides real-time pitch feedback, allowing users to select their desired pitch. This innovation enhances musical precision and empowers musicians, offering a valuable tool for the entire musical community.
